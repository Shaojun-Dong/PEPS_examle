This repository contains the example codes about how to use the TNSPackage


Heishenberg_PBC:
         An example code of PEPS on Heisenberg model. Simple update and then contract the whole 
      tensor network for the energy. This is the code that showed in 
                        Computer Physics Communications 228, 163 (2018)

Heisenberg:
         An example code of PEPS on Heisenberg model. OBC system. Simple update and then 
      contract the whole tensor network through double layer for the energy.

Heisenberg_Parity:
         An example code of PEPS on Heisenberg model with the symmetry of Parity. OBC system.
      Simple update and then contract the whole tensor network through double layer for 
      the energy.

Heisenberg_U1:
         An example code of PEPS on Heisenberg model with the symmetry of U(1). OBC system.
      Simple update and then contract the whole tensor network through double layer for 
      the energy.

electron_Parity:
         An example code of PEPS on free electron model with the symmetry of Parity. OBC 
      system. Simple update and then contract the whole tensor network through double layer
      for the energy.

electron_U1:
         An example code of PEPS on free electron model with the symmetry of U(1). OBC 
      system. Simple update and then contract the whole tensor network through double layer
      for the energy.

Heisenberg_eig:
         An example code of eigenvalue problem on Heisenberg, OBC system. One should link the
      code with the arparck to run the program.

electron_Parity_eig:
         An example code of eigenvalue problem on free electron with Parity syymetry, OBC 
      system. One should link the code with the arparck to run the program.

electron_U1_eig:
         An example code of eigenvalue problem on free electron with U(1) syymetry, OBC 
      system. One should link the code with the arparck to run the program.
